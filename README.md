# Used Car ðŸš— Price ðŸ’¸ Prediction 

A ML project to predict price of second hand cars so that people can save time instead of searching on websites to find the desired price.


## Steps : 

1. Web Scrapping : Dataset was created using web scrapping techniques from a well renowed website <strong>cacardekho.com</strong>

2. EDA and Data Preprocessing : I tried to find out patterns in the dataset and preprocessed it accordingly.

3. Best ML Model : Best ML Model comes out to be Random Forest Regressor


## Web Application 

1. Web Applications runs on Flask Framework

2. Use Following Commands to run on your system (runs on localhost:5000)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```


## EDA ðŸ“Š

4. Petrol Variant is cheaper than Diesel
5. Automatic Transmission is Costlier than Mannual Transmission Variant
